**Problem Statement:**

Engagement/Retention:
Koo has been seeing an increase in DAU but now wants to improve upon the DAU/MAU ratio,
an indication of engagement/stickiness for any social platform. Suggest 3 Product solutions for
the same. Consider the following :-

● How would you market the value proposition to a user of Koo?

● How would you design it to increase the engagement? (Keep India/Bharat users in mind while designing. Balsamiq, Figma wireframe preferred)

● What are the key metrics you’d measure for both the features?

● Write a blog post announcing the launch of your Product solutions.

For the above, please state any assumptions you make.
